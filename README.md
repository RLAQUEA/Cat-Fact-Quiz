Cat Fact Quiz


This is a quiz that asks the user five questions about cats.  When the start button is clicked, the timer starts at 75 seconds and counts down.  

Every time a question is answered incorrectly, the timer subtracts 10 seconds from the time which is the user's score at the end of the game.  

When the timer runs out, or all of the questions have been answered, the user is prompted to enter her initials and the high scores are saved in another page using local storage.
